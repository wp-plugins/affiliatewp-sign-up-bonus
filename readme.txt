Entice more affiliates to register by offering a sign up bonus.

== Description ==

> This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") in order to function.

It can sometimes be difficult to get affiliates to register on your website. This plugin aims to make this easier by enticing affiliates with a sign up bonus. 

**How it works**

When an affiliate registers through the AffiliateWP registration form or is manually added from within the admin, a sign up bonus will be given to the affiliate in the form of a referral. The amount of the bonus can be configured from Affiliates &rarr; Settings &rarr; Integrations

The referral will be created with a description of "Sign Up Bonus" which can be viewed from Affiliates â†’ Referrals. The affiliate will see this on their affiliate dashboard under "Unpaid Earnings".

When AffiliateWP's "Require approval" option is enabled, the affiliate will not receive the sign up bonus until their application is approved.

Note: It would be a good idea to include a minimum payout amount in your site's affiliate terms and conditions or you may have affiliates registering and requesting a payout straight away.

It aims to provide everything you need in a simple, clean, easy to use system that you will love to use.
