Entice more affiliates to register by offering them a sign up bonus

== Description ==

> This plugin requires [AffiliateWP](http://affiliatewp.com/ "AffiliateWP") in order to function.

Offering a sign up bonus is a great way to entice more affiliates to register on your site. In turn these affiliates will go on to promote your products and services, making you more sales. 

**How it works**

When an affiliate registers through the AfiliateWP registration form, or you manually add an affiliate from within the admin, a sign up bonus will be awarded (amount set from within the settings). This bonus is created in the form of a referral with a description of "Sign Up Bonus", which can be viewed from the Affiliates &rarr; Referrals screen in the admin. The affiliate will see this on their affiliate dashboard under "Unpaid Earnings".

When "Require approval" is enabled from AffiliateWP's settings, the affiliate will not receive the sign up bonus until their application is approved. Likewise, if you manually add an affiliate from within the admin, the sign up bonus is not created until they are approved.

Note: It would be a good idea to include information in your affiliate terms and conditions about a minimum payout amount, or you'll have affiliates joining and requesting a payout straight away.
